<p> Random Access Memory, this is used for quick access to files, games etc.
<p>This allows the PC to not lag and stutter as even taking the stuff from an M.2 SSD will cause it to not run as smoothly as with RAM.</p>
<p> You get ram in GB so the most common is 16gb for gaming rigs and higher for workstations as they need to load more applications.</p>
    <p>They have different speeds which is measured in MHz (Megahertz) so 3200 MHz is most common for gaming and higher is normally better, but sometimes the motherboard can't run that speed of RAM so it will have to do the highest it can manage. </p>
