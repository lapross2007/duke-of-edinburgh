    <div class="title">RAM</div>
    <p> Random Access Memory, this is used for quick access to files, small game files etc.</p>
    <p>This allows the PC to not lag and stutter as even taking the stuff from an M.2 SSD(One of the fastest storage device types available) will cause it to not run as
        smoothly as with RAM.</p>
    <p> You get ram in GB so the most common is 16gb for gaming rigs and higher for workstations as they need to load more
        applications.</p>
    <p>They have different speeds which is measured in MHz (Megahertz) so 3200 MHz is most common for gaming and higher is
        normally better, but sometimes the <a href="/motherboard"> motherboard</a> can't run that speed of RAM so it will have to do the highest it can
        manage. </p>

    <p>Just because the RAM has a high speed doesn't always mean that it is running that speed.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the default speed isn't the highest possible for that set of RAM in which you will need to change the bios
        to enable it's full speed</p>
    <p>Other times it is because the Motherboard doesn't support that speed of RAM. </p>
    <p>Most Motherboards can support the common speeds like 3200MHz but cheaper boards might not be able to support higher
        speeds such as 4000MHz </p>
    <p>However, unless you need a high end computer 4000MHz is not necessary</p>
